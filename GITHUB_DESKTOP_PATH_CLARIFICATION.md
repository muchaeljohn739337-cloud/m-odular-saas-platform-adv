# 🚨 GITHUB DESKTOP PATH - CLARIFICATION

---

## ⚠️ WHAT YOU'RE SEEING

The path you found:
```
C:\Users\mucha.DESKTOP-H7T9NPM\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\app-3.5.3\
```

**This is NOT where to clone!** ❌

This is GitHub Desktop's **internal application folder** where the software itself is installed.

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD

### Don't clone to GitHub Desktop's app folder!

Instead, clone to a normal folder like:
```
C:\Users\mucha.DESKTOP-H7T9NPM\
```

Or:
```
C:\Users\mucha.DESKTOP-H7T9NPM\Documents\Projects\
```

Or anywhere you want to work!

## 📋 THE CORRECT URL TO CLONE

```
https://github.com/pdtribe181-prog/-modular-saas-platform.git
```

(Note the hyphen `-` at the start!)

## 🎓 WHY THIS MATTERS

### App Folders vs Work Folders

**GitHub Desktop App Folder:**
- Read-only (shouldn't edit)
- Updated by GitHub Desktop
- Gets deleted on updates
- For GitHub Desktop software only

**Your Project Folder:**
- Your repository code
- Where you do all work
- Persistent and safe
- You have full control
