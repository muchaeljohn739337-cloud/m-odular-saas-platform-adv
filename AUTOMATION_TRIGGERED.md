## 📊 **What's Happening Right Now:**

### **1. GitHub Actions Workflow Started** ⏳

The workflow is running these steps:

```
Step 1: Test Build
  ├─ Checkout code
  ├─ Setup Node.js
  ├─ Install backend dependencies
  ├─ Compile TypeScript (backend)
  ├─ Run backend linting
  ├─ Install frontend dependencies
  ├─ Build frontend (Next.js)
  └─ Run frontend linting

Step 2: Deploy (if tests pass)
  ├─ Trigger Backend Deploy Hook
  └─ Trigger Frontend Deploy Hook
```

### **2. Watch Progress Here:**

**GitHub Actions:**
