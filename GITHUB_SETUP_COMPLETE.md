## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS EXPLAINED

### What is Git?
```
Git = Version control system
Think of it like: Google Docs but for code

What it does:
- Saves every change you make
- Lets you go back to old versions
- Lets multiple people work together
- Tracks who changed what
```

### What is GitHub?
```
GitHub = Cloud storage for Git
Think of it like: Dropbox for code

What it does:
- Stores your code online
- Lets you access from anywhere
- Lets you share with team
- Has CI/CD automation
```

### What is a Repository?
```
Repository = Folder with code + git history
Think of it like: A complete project folder

What it contains:
- All your code files
- All version history
- All configuration
- All documentation
```

### What is Cloning?
```
Clone = Copy everything from GitHub to your computer
Think of it like: Download a folder

What happens:
1. Downloads all files
2. Downloads entire history
3. Connects to GitHub
4. Ready to work locally
```

### What is "main" branch?
```
Branch = A version of your code
Main = The primary/production version

Typical flow:
feature → test → main → production
 (new)   (QA)  (stable) (live)
```
